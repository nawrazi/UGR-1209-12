            <p>
                When you visit our Website, we collect certain information related to
                your device, such as your IP address, what pages you visit on our
                Website, whether you were referred to by another website, and at what
                time you accessed our Website. We will not collect any data without
                your prior explicit consent. We do not collect any other type of
                personal data. If you are accessing our website through a social media
                account, please refer to the social media provider’s privacy policy for
                information regarding their data collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes
                internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
                provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/timestamp,
                and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track
                user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic
                information for aggregate use.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use pixel tags, which are small graphic files that allow us and
                our trusted third party partners to track your Website usage and
                collect usage data, including the number of pages you visit, the
                time you spend on each page, what you click on next, and other
                information about your Website visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit
                our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your
                name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits
                to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about
                goods and services of interest to you
            </p>
            <p>
                Advertisers, as third-party vendors, use cookies to collect usage and
                demographic data in order to serve ads on our site. For example, Google’s
                use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their
                visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of
                the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network
